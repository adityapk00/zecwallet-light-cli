## Privacy 
* While all the keys and transaction detection happens on the client, the server can learn what blocks contain your shielded transactions.
* The server also learns other metadata about you like your ip address etc...
* Also remember that t-addresses don't provide any privacy protection.

## Notes:
* The wallet connects to the mainnet by default. To connect to testnet, please pass `--server https://lightd-test.zecwallet.co:443`
* If you want to run your own server, please see [zecwallet lightwalletd](https://github.com/adityapk00/lightwalletd), and then run `./zecwallet-cli --server http://127.0.0.1:9067`. You might also need to pass `--dangerous` if you are using a self-signed  TLS certificate.

* The log file is in `~/.zcash/zecwallet-light-wallet.debug.log`. Wallet is stored in `~/.zcash/zecwallet-light-wallet.dat`

### Note Management
Zecwallet-CLI does automatic note and utxo management, which means it doesn't allow you to manually select which address to send outgoing transactions from. It follows these principles:
* Defaults to sending shielded transactions, even if you're sending to a transparent address
* Sapling funds need at least 5 confirmations before they can be spent
* Can select funds from multiple shielded addresses in the same transaction
* Will automatically shield your transparent funds at the first opportunity
    * When sending an outgoing transaction to a shielded address, Zecwallet-CLI can decide to use the transaction to additionally shield your transparent funds (i.e., send your transparent funds to your own shielded address in the same transaction)

## Compiling from source
